# Overview

This project demonstrates how to combine following techniques together:

- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) using [Spock](https://spockframework.org/)
- Modular architecture
- Unit testing of modules
- Integration testing with [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/)
- Mutation testing using [Pitest](https://pitest.org/)
- Automated code formatting

The goal is to present complete and efficient software development process presented below.
