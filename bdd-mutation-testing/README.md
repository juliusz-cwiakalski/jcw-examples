# Full Spectrum Software Delivery and Testing: Mastering Modern Development with BDD, Modularity, and Beyond

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of software development, mastering a spectrum of testing and development methodologies is
crucial for delivering high-quality software.
This article dives into an integrated approach that leverages cutting-edge techniques to enhance the development
lifecycle:

- **Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)** using [Spock](https://spockframework.org/), which bridges the communication gap
  between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that all parties understand the system's
  behavior.
- **Modular architecture**, which simplifies development, testing and maintenance by dividing systems into manageable,
  easy to understand modules.
- **Unit testing of modules** to ensure each component functions correctly in isolation, enhancing the robustness of the
  software.
- **Integration testing with [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/)**, which offers a reliable environment for
  testing how modules interact with each other and with external services.
- **Mutation testing using [Pitest](https://pitest.org/)**, which challenges your tests by introducing changes to the
  codebase to verify that the tests can detect errors effectively.
- **Automated code formatting**, which maintains consistency and readability across the codebase, reducing the cognitive
  load on developers.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a holistic and efficient software development process that not only focuses
on technical execution but also emphasizes the importance of communication and understanding across different teams.
By integrating these techniques,
the article aims to provide a blueprint for a streamlined, effective development pipeline
suitable for projects of any size in todayâ€™s fast-paced tech environment.

## Key Lessons and Evolving Strategies

TODO describe what I've tried over the years and comment on conclusions and lessons learned, for example:

- mutation testing does not work with integration testing
- class unit testing + mocking brings little value + cements the code (hard refactoring)
- test pyramid -> test diamond -> back to test pyramid - when to use what?
- integration tests fits CRUDs, unit tests when there's logic
- there are two types of tests - fast and slow
- unit and integration tests alone are not enough -> e2e / contract testing / manual testing still needed
- code coverage alone is dangerous! 
- ...

- [ ] Rewrite high level requirements as BDD Spock specification
- [ ] Implement modules unit tests
- [ ] Implement example REST API
- [ ] Implement integration tests for key functionalities
- [ ] Describe basic terms: BDD, mutational testing
- [ ] Describe some history and evolution of approaches I take
- [ ] List of useful resources
- [ ] Should I always use all the tools?
- [ ] General hints
