## Introduction

**Note**: Short on time? Read **TL-TR** sections to get straight to the point. ;-)

In the rapidly evolving world of software development, mastering a spectrum of testing and development methodologies is
crucial for delivering high-quality software.
This article dives into an integrated approach that leverages cutting-edge techniques to enhance the development
lifecycle:

- **Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)** using [Spock](https://spockframework.org/), which bridges the communication gap
  between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that all parties understand the system's
  behavior.
- **Modular architecture**, which simplifies development, testing and maintenance by dividing systems into manageable,
  easy to understand modules.
- **Unit testing of modules** to ensure each component functions correctly in isolation, enhancing the robustness of the
  software.
- **Integration testing with [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/)**, which offers a reliable environment for
  testing how modules interact with each other and with external services.
- **Mutation testing using [Pitest](https://pitest.org/)**, which challenges your tests by introducing changes to the
  codebase to verify that the tests can detect errors effectively.
- **Automated code formatting**, which maintains consistency and readability across the codebase, reducing the cognitive
  load on developers.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a holistic and efficient software development process that not only focuses
on technical execution but also emphasizes the importance of communication and understanding across different teams.
By integrating these techniques,
the article aims to provide a blueprint for a streamlined, effective development pipeline
suitable for projects of any size in todayâ€™s fast-paced tech environment.

## Problems Addressed by Modern Software Development Techniques

### Communication Gaps Between Developers, Testers, and Stakeholders

**Problem:** Causes misunderstandings and poor information flow.

**Consequences:**

- Unclear understanding of requirements leads to inaccurate implementations.
- Undefined acceptance criteria result in ineffective testing.
- Misalignment of project goals with stakeholder expectations causes rework and delays.
- Lack of visibility into the development process results in unmet business needs.

### Missing or Insufficient Business Requirements

**Problem:** Causes waste and delays due to changes in requirements, rework, discussions, and clarifications.

**Consequences:**

- Increased time and effort spent on rework and clarifications.
- Delays in project timelines due to constant requirement changes.
- Reduced developer productivity and morale.
- Difficulty in planning and estimating project scope.
- Increased risk of delivering a product that does not meet business needs.
- Higher chances of miscommunication between team members and stakeholders.

### Late Changes to Business Requirements

**Problem:** Causes delay and waste due to rework required.

**Consequences:**

- Increased project costs due to additional development and testing cycles.
- Delays in project delivery as teams adjust to new requirements.
- Frustration among team members due to shifting priorities and rework.
- Reduced focus on quality as teams rush to implement changes.
- Difficulty in maintaining consistent project progress.

### Poor Quality of Tests

**Problem:** Despite high coverage, tests are not detecting bugs.

**Consequences:**

- False sense of security leading to undetected bugs in production.
- Increased debugging and fixing efforts post-deployment.
- Higher maintenance costs due to frequent issues.
- Erosion of stakeholder trust in the development process.
- Inefficiencies in the development cycle as poor tests provide misleading results.

### Difficulty in Refactoring

**Problem:** Caused by tests focusing on the implementation details instead of the requirements.

**Consequences:**

- Increased complexity and risk during refactoring.
- Hesitancy to improve or refactor code due to fear of breaking existing functionality.
- Accumulation of technical debt over time.
- Slower development pace as code becomes harder to maintain and extend.
- Difficulty in onboarding new developers due to a complex and rigid codebase.

### Long Build Times

**Problem:** Too much integration or end-to-end (e2e) testing increases the code-test cycle, slowing down the process
and discouraging the use of TDD/BDD.

**Consequences:**

- Decreased developer productivity due to waiting for builds and tests to complete.
- Reduced frequency of code commits and integrations, leading to larger and riskier changes.
- Discouragement of best practices like TDD and BDD.
- Longer feedback loop, making it harder to detect and fix issues early.
- Increased frustration and decreased morale among developers.

### Big Ball of Mud

**Problem:** No real or clear structure or architecture in the project, making it hard to maintain and extend.

**Consequences:**

- Difficulty in understanding and navigating the codebase.
- Increased time and effort required to implement new features or fix bugs.
- Higher likelihood of introducing defects due to lack of structure.
- Difficulty in scaling the project as it grows.
- Increased onboarding time for new developers.

### Cognitive Overload

**Problem:** Large modules with wide responsibilities and numerous dependencies and connections, leading to cognitive
overload.

**Consequences:**

- Developers spend more time understanding complex modules, leading to slower progress and higher error rates.
- The mental effort required to navigate and comprehend large, interconnected modules contributes to higher stress
  levels and burnout among team members.
- Large modules with extensive intra- and inter-connections make it challenging for developers to stay focused and clear
  on their tasks.
- The complexity of understanding how different parts of the module interact hinders quick decision-making and efficient
  problem-solving.
- The cognitive load from dealing with complex, large modules stifles creativity and innovation, leading to lower
  quality solutions and less effective problem-solving.

----

## Building a Modular Architecture

Modular architecture greatly improves the delivery process and software in many fields.
It reduces complexity and cognitive overload, and increases testability and maintainability.

### Characteristics of a Good Module

- **Single Responsibility:** Ideally focused around an action or step in a process (verbs) rather than entities (nouns).
- **Well-Defined Public API:** Exposes the functionality provided by the module to the outside world.
- **Encapsulation:** Internal implementation details are hidden behind the public API.
- **Loosely Coupled:** Depends only on the public APIs of other modules.
- **High Cohesion:** Bundles together related aspects.
- **Independent Data Storage:** Persisted data is independent of other modules and is accessible only via the module's
  public API.

### Structuring a Project for Modular Architecture

There are many possible structures for a project that embraces modular architecture. One effective approach is using a
single package when working with Java (and this can be applied to other languages as well).

The following are the building blocks of a module in this approach:

- **Public API:** Public Java access
    - **Facade:** Exposes the methods to the outside world of the module.
      Facade resides in the main module package, so it can access all module package private classes
    - **DTOs:** Used in the facade to expose data to the outside world.
      Extracted to a separate subpackage called `api` so it can be easily distinguished from implementation
- **Internal Implementation:** Package-private Java accessâ€”all resides in the main module package
    - **Module Configuration:** A factory class that constructs the module facade and the module's internal
      dependencies (repositories, etc.). It also shows the external dependencies required for the module.
    - **Internal Dependencies Interfaces:** For example, the API of repositories, message/event publishers, etc.
    - **Internal Implementation Classes:**
        - Entities
        - Repositories implementation
        - Services (if required, a small module can have all the "service" logic directly in the facade)
        - ...
- **Exposing Public API via Required Protocols:** Separate subpackage packages with all classes in package-private
  scope.
    - **Message/Event Consumers:** Consume the event and call the module's public API via facade (for
      example, `listeners` subpackage).
    - **gRPC/GraphQL/REST Controllers (etc.):** Convert external synchronous calls into the public API (facade) calls (
      for example `web` subpackage).

#### Example project structure

This example demonstrates the structure of a module
that is receiving the `OrderCompletedEvent` and generates the invoice.
Once invoice is generated it publishes the `InvoiceIssuedEvent`.
It also provides a web API to fetch the invoices for a customer.

```plaintext
src
â””â”€â”€ main
    â””â”€â”€ java
        â””â”€â”€ com
            â””â”€â”€ example
                â””â”€â”€ issueinvoice
                    â”œâ”€â”€ IssueInvoiceFacade.java [public]
                    â”œâ”€â”€ api
                    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ InvoiceDTO.java [public]
                    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ InvoiceIssuedEvent.java [public]
                    â”œâ”€â”€ IssueInvoiceConfiguration.java
                    â”œâ”€â”€ InvoiceRepository.java
                    â”œâ”€â”€ Invoice.java
                    â”œâ”€â”€ InvoiceRepositoryImpl.java
                    â”œâ”€â”€ IssueInvoiceService.java
                    â”œâ”€â”€ listeners
                    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ OrderCompletedEventListener.java
                    â””â”€â”€ web
                        â”œâ”€â”€ InvoiceController.java
                        â””â”€â”€ InvoiceGraphQLResolver.java
```

Having all classes related to a module in one package may feel odd at first. We've been taught at universities and
courses to have separate packages for entities, repositories, services, etc. You might also think that you'll end up
with too many classes in a single package and that it will be hard to navigate.

However, when modules are focused around behavior/process steps/verbs (for example, `user-registration`) instead of
entities/nouns (`user`), you'll discover that the scope of a module is usually narrow and contains a manageable number
of classes (typically 1â€“3 dozen). If you create a module that has significantly more classes, then it's probably taking
on too much responsibility and should be split into several modules.

### Transitioning from Modular Monolith to Microservices

Embracing modular architecture has one more benefit. If you find a good reason to extract some functionality as a
separate microservice, it's easier than extracting it from a big ball of mud.

In theory, you cut the module and paste it into a new repository. However, it's not always straightforward due to
differences between local modules and microservices:

1. Local calls are much faster.
2. Local calls are free from network issues.
3. Local calls share transactions.

## The Role of Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) focuses on software behaviors (features) rather than implementation details. The
perspective to take is: what is the desired outcome? BDD tests do not concern themselves with how the behavior is
implemented. This aligns closely with business goals and the business mindset. In the end, users want to make their
lives easier and get the job done. They don't care about the technical details of how the software works.

The consequence of this perspective is that tests focus on verifying the correct outcomes (what happens) rather than the
implementation details (how it happens).

### Advantages of BDD

- **Readability:** BDD test code is more readable and may serve as a living documentation or specification of
  functionality.
- **Refactoring-Proof:** Tests focus on the outcome, not the implementation details, allowing developers to change the
  internal logic without altering the test code.
- **Encourages Better Design:** Easy refactoring encourages better internal structure and code quality, leading to
  greater maintainability and reduced delivery times.
- **Improved Communication:** BDD promotes better communication between developers, testers, and business stakeholders,
  ensuring everyone has a clear understanding of the requirements and expected outcomes.
- **Early Bug Detection:** By focusing on expected behaviors, BDD helps in catching discrepancies and bugs early in the
  development process.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** BDD frameworks often use natural language for test descriptions, making it easier for
  non-technical stakeholders to understand and contribute to the development process.
- **User-Centric Approach:** By prioritizing user-focused outcomes, BDD ensures that the software delivers value to
  end-users, aligning development efforts with business objectives.

BDD shifts the focus from how features are implemented to what the features should achieve, aligning development efforts
with business goals and user needs.
This approach not only improves code quality and maintainability but also fosters
better communication and collaboration among all stakeholders involved in the software development process.

### Tips for Creating Effective BDD Scenarios

1. **Focus on User Behavior:**
    - Write scenarios from the user's perspective, describing how they interact with the system and what they expect as
      outcomes.

2. **Use Clear and Simple Language:**
    - Avoid technical jargon and complex sentences. Use simple and clear language that can be easily understood by all
      stakeholders.

3. **Follow the Given-When-Then Structure:**
    - Use the Given-When-Then format to structure scenarios:
        - **Given:** the initial context or setup.
        - **When:** the action or event that triggers the behavior.
        - **Then:** the expected outcome or result.

4. **Be Specific and Concrete:**
    - Provide specific details and examples to avoid ambiguity. Clearly define inputs, actions, and expected results.

5. **Keep Scenarios Focused:**
    - Each scenario should test one specific behavior or feature. Avoid combining multiple behaviors into a single
      scenario.

6. **Avoid Implementation Details:**
    - Focus on what the system should do, not how it should do it. Keep scenarios high-level and outcome-focused.

7. **Show Relevant Data:**
    - In the `Given` section, show relevant data and hide irrelevant data. Use templates with reasonable defaults and
      only set values that alter the behavior under test.

8. **Collaborate with Stakeholders:**
    - Involve developers, testers, business analysts, and other stakeholders in writing and reviewing scenarios to
      ensure they capture the correct requirements and expectations.

9. **Prioritize User Value:**
    - Write scenarios that reflect the most valuable and critical user interactions first. Focus on behaviors that
      deliver the most significant impact to users.

10. **Review and Refine:**
    - Regularly review and refine scenarios to ensure they remain relevant and accurate as the project evolves.

11. **Use Consistent Terminology:**
    - Use consistent terminology across scenarios to avoid confusion and ensure clarity. Define key terms and use them
      consistently.

12. **Leverage Examples:**
    - Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts.
      Examples help in clarifying expectations and reducing misunderstandings.

13. **Automate Scenarios:**
    - Automate BDD scenarios using appropriate tools and frameworks to ensure they are regularly executed and validated
      as part of the development process.

14. **Gherkin is Not a Requirement for BDD:**
    - You can write BDD scenarios using plain xUnit or other testing frameworks by following the above tips
      and extracting test steps into well-named methods
      that represent high-level concepts and hide implementation details.
      Spock is an excellent choice for this approach, as it enhances readability and simplifies development.

## Comprehensive Testing: From Unit to Integration

There are only two types of tests: very fast and very slow. We want to test as many behaviors as possible using very
fast tests, as we want to have multiple scenarios without extending the waiting time during the red-green-refactor cycle
of TDD.

To keep the tests running very fast, we need to eliminate any I/O from the testsâ€”they must run purely in memory.

A great way to have very fast and valuable behavior-driven tests is through unit tests where the module is treated as
the unit under test.
Using the modular architecture described above, this is relatively easy.
We can mock other modules'
facades and encapsulate any external dependencies (like REST APIs, event publishers, etc.) in interfaces that can be
easily mocked.

On the other hand, any internal I/O-dependent logic like storage/repositories must be encapsulated in interfaces with
two implementations that work identically from a behavior perspective:

1. **In-Memory Implementation:** Superfast and can be used in very fast tests.
   It can even be used in a demo version of the app!
2. **Persistent Implementation:** Uses real databases/storages and is used in integration tests and in the production
   setup.

Taking this approach gives us the opportunity to test a great number of business behaviors using very fast unit tests!

We just need to add a few happy path scenarios to our integration tests suite. Integration tests should use external
APIs as much as possible, for example:

1. Call real REST API
2. Publish/listen to real events on Kafka
3. Mock external system REST API with Wiremock

An additional key aspect is that in tests, we have to use the module configuration class to instantiate a fully
operational module facade.
It should have two methods:

1. A method that creates the facade and takes the required dependencies (this is used in integration tests and in
   production environments).
2. A method that calls the first one but creates in-memory internal dependencies (external dependencies still have to be
   provided).
   This method is used by very fast unit tests.

----

## Enhancing Test Reliability with Mutation Testing

Having good BDD descriptions and unit tests with high coverage alone is not enough.
I've seen way too many tests that only check the status of the operation or that no error was thrown.
This kind of test is created when there's pressure
to have high code coverage instead of pressure to have high-quality tests.
Focusing on code coverage alone is dangerous.
It gives a false sense of safetyâ€”"we have 90% code coverage, so we have it all tested."
One must understand that if
assertions are poor, then even 100% code coverage will detect few bugs!

Fortunately, there's a way to verify if test assertions are good: mutation testing.
The idea is to break the production code on purpose (introduce code mutations) and check if the tests detect these bugs.
If a test fails after the change (mutant is killed), it means the test is of high quality (can detect bugs).

Manual modification and execution of tests are tedious and impractical.
Fortunately, there are tools available to do this job for us automatically.
In the example Java project, the [Pitest.org](https://pitest.org/) tool is used, but
there are alternative solutions available for most popular languages.

Pitest uses the code coverage to understand what tests are covering every line of code.
Next, Pitest introduces code mutations in production code and runs the tests that are covering the changed line.
Tests covering the line are executed
until the first failure (mutant is killed, so the tests are good) or until all tests are executed (meaning that mutant
survived and tests are poor).

Example mutations can include inverting logical conditions, returning null, etc. See the
full [list of mutations](https://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators/) for more details.

Mutation testing seems to be a great approach to increasing the quality of our tests.
However, there's a significant limitation resulting from how the solution works.
As explained above, the same tests are repeated over and over again,
which may take significant time if tests are slow.
Because of this fact, mutation testing is suitable only for unit
tests that are very fast.
Integration tests usually take way too much time.
There's another problem with combining integration testing with mutation testing.
Usually, integration tests share some common state (especially when running in parallel).
Introducing the mutations may break this state and cause great test instability.

Fortunately, module unit tests described above work perfectly with mutation testing, as you can configure Pitest to only
use the unit tests (see `excludedTestClasses` configuration in the project setup).

## Automating Code Quality

To maintain high code quality, it is helpful to integrate static code analysis tools like Sonar into your CI pipeline.
This integration provides immediate feedback on any changes made to the codebase. 
Additionally,
installing [SonarLint](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) in your IDE allows you to see violations in
real-time as you write code.

Another important aspect of automating code quality is setting up an automated code formatter.
This saves time during development (no decisions about how to format) and code reviews (no comments about formatting).
The example project uses [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless),
a tool that automates code formatting and verifies during the
build process whether the code is properly formatted.
Spotless leverages various plugins for formatting logic, and the
example project uses the [Google Java formatter](https://github.com/google/google-java-format).

Additionally, you can enhance your workflow by setting up a pre-commit hook that formats the code before it is
committed. This ensures that all code adheres to the formatting standards before being added to the repository.

## [TL-TR] Delivery Process Steps Summary

1. Start with business need definition and clarification
    - Describe the problem the software should tackle with
    - Define key objectives
    - Define high-level features or stories that software should support
    - Identify and document non-functional requirements (NFRs)
    - Conduct initial feasibility analysis (technical and financial)
    - Develop prototypes for key components or the entire system to validate assumptions and gather early feedback.

2. Design what modules must be modified and what changes are required
    - List of components and their responsibilities
    - Diagram explaining the dependencies
    - Main processes description (and diagrams if required)
    - Ensure design addresses non-functional requirements

3. Select functionality subset for iteration, and:
    1. Extend the design with process(es) description to make sure that process aspects relevant for iteration are clear
       and complete.
    2. Double check if UI mockups are available and confirmed by all stakeholders.
    3. Describe in BDD terms the expected behaviors of the components that have to be changed.
       Document any additional acceptance criteria that are not described in BDD scenarios.
    4. Detailed review of BDD scenarios done by developers / QAs / product owner and other stakeholders
    5. Correct structure of BDD and map scenarios to modules. Run scenarios and review the spock report readability.
    6. Implement module unit BDD scenarios (design the module facade API).
    7. Implement the module facade that fulfills all the module unit BDD specifications.
    8. Implement the repositories' unit/integration tests
    9. Implement BDD integration tests for key scenarios
    10. Verify coverage and test strength + improve/extend tests to cover mutations (CI Quality gate)
    11. Integrate and deploy using fully automated CI/CD
    12. Collect user feedback, refine requirements and improve the system based on user experiences
    13. Conduct retrospective to evaluate what went well, and what could be improved for future iterations. Capture
        lessons learned and plan improvement actions

## Example Project Overview

Usually, tutorials and articles demonstrating some technique use simple examples
not to distract the reader from the main point.
The Goal of this article is to provide the full working solution of the delivery process which is very complex in
nature.
I decided to build a more complex example following the process described above,
so it not only presents the techniques like BDD or mutation testing,
but it also presents the proposed process in practice.
The project's Git history may be reviewed to see what the steps are.
Please note that implementation will not provide full features scope but it
(and Git history) will demonstrate how such a project could be developed.

## [TL-TR] Project Structure and Execution

### Build the Project and Review Test Reports

Run `./gradlew b` and review the test reports:

- [Spock report](./build/spock-reports/index.html) - human-friendly report that is a functional requirements
  specification
  and can be reviewed by business stakeholders
- [Pitest report](./build/reports/pitest/index.html) - mutational tests report that shows the weak spots in BDD module
  unit tests

### Key Setup Requirements for Your Project

TODO:

- [ ] spock parallelization
- [ ] pitest
- [ ] spock report + pitest hack
- [ ] spotless + pre-commit hook
- [ ] setup for maven project

## Key Lessons and Evolving Strategies

Over time, I've experimented with a number of approaches and techniques in software development.
Some ideas turned out to be great, others turned out to be the opposite.
This section summarizes the most important lessons I've learned.

### Mutation Testing Does Not Work Well with Integration Testing

The headline is not entirely true. Mutation tests do work with integration tests. Mostly...

The main problem here is execution time.
As explained in the section about mutation testing,
the same tests could be re-executed multiple times on multiple versions of mutated production code.
Integration tests are slow.
Repeating them multiple times makes the build super slow.
Build time can easily take 30 minutes... or 60 minutes... or...

Another aspect is that some mutations may silently break the shared state that is usually used in integration tests (for
example, the database), which is even more frustrating as you start to get unstable or false results.

**Key takeaway:** After initial success with making integration and mutation tests work together (which looked
promising), we decided to exclude integration tests due to long build times and instability.

### Class Unit Testing with Intensive Mocking Makes Refactoring Hard and Misses Many Bugs

In the past, writing tests was not very popular.
When I started my career in 2007, some degree of testing was used,
but it was not uncommon to rely mostly on manual testing.
Many of my friends working in different companies experienced the same.

Over time, it became clear that this approach was unsustainable.
Long release cycles and many regression bugs forced us to look for better ways of working.
At some point, unit tests started to gain popularity.
They promised stable and bug-free releases and short testing times.
Code coverage often became a key metric that developers (and managers) started focusing on.

There was a strong emphasis on making unit tests focus solely on a unit, and classes seemed to be an obvious choice.
Of course, unit tests must be stable and fastâ€”so we started mocking their dependencies to control them.
In projects focusing on these two conceptsâ€”mocking dependencies and achieving high code coverageâ€”unit tests turned out
to be problematic:

1. Tests were green with mocked dependencies, but when we plugged in real implementations, it turned out that they
   behaved differently than mocks and did not work well together.
   Despite having a huge test suite, many bugs still made it into production.
2. Creating unit tests with many mocks is time-consuming and tedious, especially when the design is poor, and classes
   have many dependencies.
3. The worst problem is that this approach makes changes and refactoring very hard.
   Moving logic around, extracting classes, etc., requires a lot of refactoring on the unit test side as well.
   Over time, this issue makes the project an unmaintainable nightmare as no one wants to improve it.

These problems led to frustration and undermined the value of testing from many developers' perspectives.

After years of writing poor unit tests and feeling frustrated each time I had to change something, I discovered that
unit tests are great when we change the "unit."
If you take a module (as described in the section about modular architecture) as a unit under test,
then all the problems listed above disappear.
The module has a narrow and well-defined API that encapsulates all internal details.
Using only this API in unit tests makes it straightforward to refactor the internal structure and improve the code.
Since we're using real implementations of internal building blocks, we are sure they work well together.
Additionally, we save time with easier mocking as we only have to mock
external dependencies and not internal class implementations.

Another discovery I made was that Behavior Driven Development (BDD) works great with unit tests!
When I started focusing only on expected behaviors and outcomes in tests and ignored internal implementation details,
logic became easier to refactor.
I could completely change the internal implementation as long as the behavior remained unchanged from the external
client's perspective.
Another great benefit of BDD is that it can be used as a requirement specification.

**Key takeaway:** Create unit tests for whole modules and use BDD for that.
Unit tests for single classes or methods make sense
if a class has no dependencies and/or is responsible for very complex logic (like calculations, algorithms, etc.).

### Testing in Production is an Option
Traditionally, the prevailing mindset in software development has been to prevent bugs from ever reaching production.
This approach often involves extensive testing and quality assurance processes aimed at delivering a completely bug-free
product.

However, my perspective on this changed when I joined a company with a continuous deployment pipeline and the ability to
roll back changes within minutes. This company also had a robust monitoring and alerting system based on metrics and
logs. If the error rate suddenly increased or a critical metric deviated from the norm, a PagerDuty alert would be
triggered. The on-call engineer could quickly assess the situation and decide whether to roll back the deployment to
minimize impact.

Additionally, the development process was extremely agile, enabling bug fixes to be implemented and deployed within a
very short time frameâ€”sometimes as quickly as 30â€“60 minutes for simple cases.

With this approach, we found that the cost of a bug in production was relatively small and acceptable. This allowed us
to deliver new features and updates much faster.

**Key Takeaway:** Understand the cost of bugs in your specific context.
Consider the trade-offs between delivering a bug-free release
and saving time by accepting some level of bugs while having a solid monitoring and rollback process in place.
The cost of bugs can vary depending on the context, so different approaches might be suitable for different
components or systems (e.g., microservices, critical systems).
This strategy can significantly accelerate your delivery process while maintaining acceptable quality levels.

### Other lessons

- test pyramid -> test diamond -> back to test pyramidâ€”when to use what?
- integration tests fits CRUDs, unit tests when there's logic
- there are two types of testsâ€”fast and slow
- unit and integration tests alone are not enough -> e2e / contract testing / manual testing still needed
- code coverage alone is dangerous!
- test execution and time matters! (time budget etc.)
- some tests can be shared in unit and integration tests (spock traits)
- components should be responsible for logic (verbs) not for things (nouns)
- observability is important
- integration testing via facade vs REST/message broker etc?
- enable visibility of public/package private scope in your IDE project explorer (so you can spot the facade
  immediately)
- use tmpfs in test containers to speedup tests
- for calculations or algorithms create excel examples that demonstrate the logic and how it should work - confirm with
  domain expert that it works as expected and use it as base for future tests
