### The loyalty program for an online booking system

#### Business Problem
In the competitive world of hospitality and travel, retaining customers and encouraging repeat bookings are crucial for
sustained business growth. Customers are often overwhelmed with choices, making it challenging for service providers to
stand out. Traditional loyalty efforts are not tailored enough to individual preferences and may not effectively
incentivize repeat bookings or higher spend per customer. Additionally, businesses struggle to effectively recognize and
reward their most loyal customers, which can lead to reduced customer satisfaction and loyalty.

#### Key Objectives

1. **Enhance Customer Retention:** Encourage repeat bookings by rewarding loyal customers, thereby increasing customer
   lifetime value.
2. **Personalize Marketing:** Utilize customer data to tailor promotions and communications, enhancing relevance and
   engagement.
3. **Increase Direct Bookings:** Reduce dependency on third-party platforms by making direct bookings more appealing
   through exclusive offers.
4. **Boost Revenue:** Drive incremental revenue through upselling and cross-selling opportunities targeted at loyal
   customers.
5. **Improve Competitive Edge:** Differentiate the service offering with unique loyalty perks that enhance customer
   experience.

#### Main Features of Loyalty and VIP Status Functionality

      their needs and preferences.
